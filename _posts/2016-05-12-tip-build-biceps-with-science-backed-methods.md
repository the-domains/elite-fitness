description: "Go Heavy. Since the biceps are comprised of even more growth-happy type II muscle fibers than the triceps (by at least 60%), they're more prone to grow when using heavy loads. A study by Lagally et al. found each jump in relative load (working from 30-90% of 1RM) resulted in superior muscle activation."
